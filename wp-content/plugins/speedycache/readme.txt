Other than caching SpeedyCache can also do the following:-

2. Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript resources helping your website to load faster.
3. Lazy load images so that the images can be requested only if they come into the viewport.
4. GZIP files to reduce the size of the file sent from the server.

== Caching ==
SpeedyCache caches the website by creating static files on the server and delivers those static files to most of the users who visit the website, The static files eliminate the heavy load of Querying the database for data hence the load of your website is faster.

You can preload as many pages as you want, and preloading caches the website in regular intervals of time to reduce the load on the server.

Deleting Cache on New/updating Post.
You can decide to delete the cache on the creation or updating of a post so that the cache can always stay updated.


== Minifying/Combining CSS and JS ==
SpeedyCache helps minify the JS and CSS hence it reduces the file sizes.
Combining JS combines the CSS and JS fines reducing the file count and making the server handle lesser requests.


== Cache Lifespan ==
Cache Lifespan is a way to schedule the deletion of cache.


== Exclude ==
Exclude is a way to prevent SpeedyCache from caching certain files/ user-agents/ cookies.


== CDN (Content Delivery Network) ==
CDN helps you host your static content on a distributed network optimized to deliver internet content faster it's not a replacement to a web host. It caches your files on the network edge and delivers the content to the user through the closest and fastest server.
SpeedyCache helps you integrate a CDN by rewriting the URLs of the static files you want to host on the CDN or in the Case of Cloudflare it helps with the purging of the cache on the Cloudflare servers.
